    <h1>Golden  Doodle - why  it is a great choice to buy</h1>
    <h2>Great price </h2>
    <p>On the low end for a Goldendoodle, you can expect to pay about $2,000 or as high as $4000 when you opt for a reputable breeder who is knowledgeable about the breed and its health, or when you opt for a puppy with a championship bloodline</p>
    <h3>Low-Shedding</h3>
    <p>While often touted as "hypoallergenic," Goldendoodles are not truly allergen-free, but they are low-shedding and can be a good option for people with allergies due to their coat type.
